This is a small project meant to track what different model years of golf balls look like.

Manufacturers typically change the shape or opacity of the arrow on the side of a golf ball to differentiate between different model years.

The purpose of this project is to provide a reference for what a model year golf ball looks like for when purchasing golf balls, as different model years have different behaviours.

It can also be useful for when you find a ProV1 on the course, you can tell if it's a 2023 or a 2011 and whether you should keep it or hit it into the water.
